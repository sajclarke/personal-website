              <h2 className="sm:text-3xl text-2xl title-font font-medium text-gray-900 my-4">My Background</h2>
              <p>Since I've known myself, I've always enjoyed the process of bringing an idea from concept to reality which has led me to creating visual arts, electronic circuits and more recently, computer software. I am particularly obsessed with ideas that can empower people to live better lives. Initially, I practiced as a trained electrical engineer for seven years however I was unable to resist the urge to transition to the fast-paced software industry where it is possible to immediately observe the positive impact of a technology creation on the lives of others</p>
              <h2 className="sm:text-3xl text-2xl title-font font-medium text-gray-900 my-4">What I'm currently working on</h2>
              <p className="leading-relaxed mb-8">I am currently developing custom business software at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.webstart101.com">Webstart</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.carepoint.co">Carepoint.co</a>, a healthtech startup helping doctors to provide remote care to patients inbetween visits. I previously worked as an electrical engineer at Barbados Light and Power and has won regional and international awards for his innovations.</p>
